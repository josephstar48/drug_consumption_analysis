# Drug Consumption Analysis

## Personality Traits and Drug Consumption Patterns: An Exploratory Data Analysis 

### Overview
This project explores how psychological and demographic factors influence drug consumption patterns using the UCI Drug Consumption Dataset. The analysis investigates relationships between personality traits, impulsivity, sensation-seeking, and the likelihood of using specific substances.

### Research Questions
1. Do personality traits and demographics predict the likelihood and frequency of drug consumption?
2. Are impulsive or sensation-seeking individuals more likely to use psychoactive substances (e.g., cannabis, cocaine, LSD)?
3. How do demographics such as age, gender, and education level influence drug usage patterns?
4. Can we identify clusters of users based on drug type (e.g., stimulants, depressants, hallucinogens)?
5. Is there a relationship between personality factors and the type of substances consumed?

### Hypothesis
Personality traits (such as Neuroticism, Impulsivity, and Sensation Seeking) and demographic factors (age, gender, education) significantly influence the likelihood and frequency of drug consumption.

### Data Source
**Dataset:** [Drug Consumption (UCI) â€” Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sjleshrac/drug-consumption-uci)  
**Rows:** 1,885 | **Columns:** 32

### Tools & Libraries
